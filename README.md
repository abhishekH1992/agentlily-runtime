`agentlily-runtime` is the execution layer for AgentLily instances in Lily
Protocol, the autonomous agent finance infrastructure being built on Stellar.

This repository is intentionally designed as an open-source-ready runtime
foundation, not a completed runtime product. It provides:

- A modular TypeScript runtime architecture
- One real happy-path execution flow for contributors to study and extend
- Strict typing, tests, linting, and CI scaffolding
- Clear extension points for unfinished systems

## What Exists Today

The current implementation demonstrates a narrow, credible runtime path:

1. Create an `AgentRuntime`
2. Start the runtime and register tools
3. Build a runtime context for a task
4. Execute a task through the task runner and action executor
5. Invoke a typed tool
6. Persist lightweight in-memory task history (or durable JSON file history via memoryStoragePath)
7. Emit runtime events and structured log entries

This gives contributors a working reference path without locking the project
into premature architecture.

## What Is Intentionally Unfinished

The following areas are scaffolded with interfaces, types, or placeholders and
are expected to become contributor work:

- Wallet-aware and payment-aware actions
- Persistent database and vector storage backends (basic file-based JSON persistence is supported via JsonFileMemoryStore)
- Model provider integrations (an `OpenAICompatibleModelProvider` scaffold is available for experimentation; note that it is scaffolded and intentionally not production-complete)
- Runtime policy engines and approval flows
- Long-running orchestration and scheduling
- Distributed execution and durable coordination
- Identity-aware execution logic
- Rich tracing, metrics, and production observability

## Requirements & Supported Node.js Versions

`agentlily-runtime` declares `"engines": { "node": ">=20" }`. The CI workflow actively verifies formatting, linting, typechecking, and the full test suite across a matrix of supported Node.js LTS lines:

- **Node.js 20** (Declared baseline LTS floor)
- **Node.js 22** (Active LTS)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run test
```

Example:

```ts
import { AgentRuntime } from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "local-dev"
});

runtime.registerTool({
  name: "echo",
  description: "Returns a string payload for test execution",
  async execute(input) {
    return { echoed: String(input.payload.message ?? "") };
  }
});

await runtime.start();

const result = await runtime.executeTask({
  agentId: "agent-demo",
  taskId: "task-001",
  toolName: "echo",
  input: "Send a greeting",
  payload: { message: "hello lily" }
});

console.log(result.output);
```

## Runtime Events

`agentlily-runtime` exposes an event system via `RuntimeEventBus` to support observability, audit logs, and tracing adapters.

### Event Catalog (`RuntimeEventMap`)

| Event Name               | Description                                              | Key Payload Fields                                         |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `runtime.started`        | Emitted once when `runtime.start()` succeeds             | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt`                                  |
| `runtime.stopped`        | Emitted when `runtime.stop()` completes                  | `runtimeId`, `occurredAt`                                  |
| `runtime.task.received`  | Emitted when a task is accepted for execution            | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`                           |
| `runtime.task.completed` | Emitted when a task executes successfully                | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, `durationMs` |
| `runtime.task.failed`    | Emitted when task execution fails                        | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `reason`                 |
| `runtime.tool.invoked`   | Emitted when an individual tool action is invoked        | `runtimeId`, `taskId`, `agentId`, `toolName`, `invokedAt`  |
| `runtime.internal.error` | Emitted when an event listener throws an unhandled error | `eventName`, `errorMessage`, `occurredAt`                  |

### Subscribing to Events

You can inject a custom `RuntimeEventBus` during initialization or subscribe directly via `runtime.eventBus`:

```ts
import {
  AgentRuntime,
  RuntimeEventBus
} from "@lily-protocol/agentlily-runtime";

const eventBus = new RuntimeEventBus();

// Subscribe to task completion and failure events
const unsubscribeCompleted = eventBus.on("runtime.task.completed", (event) => {
  console.log(
    `Task ${event.payload.taskId} completed in ${event.payload.durationMs}ms`
  );
});

const unsubscribeFailed = eventBus.on("runtime.task.failed", (event) => {
  console.error(`Task ${event.payload.taskId} failed: ${event.payload.reason}`);
});

// Single-fire listener
eventBus.once("runtime.started", (event) => {
  console.log(`Runtime started at ${event.payload.occurredAt}`);
});

const runtime = new AgentRuntime({
  runtimeId: "monitored-runtime",
  eventBus
});

await runtime.start();

// Unsubscribe when no longer needed
unsubscribeCompleted();
unsubscribeFailed();
```

## Scripts

- `npm run build` compiles the library
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint
- `npm run typecheck` runs TypeScript in no-emit mode
- `npm run test` runs Vitest with coverage
- `npm run verify` runs formatting, linting, typecheck, and tests

## Contributor Guidance

Good first contributions should add depth without collapsing extension points.
Examples:

- Add a new memory backend that implements `MemoryStore`
- Introduce runtime policies around tool allowlists
- Add an event sink or tracing adapter
- Implement a model provider adapter with tests
- Expand task lifecycle states beyond the current happy path

## Suggested Next Issues

Maintainers can immediately create issues around:

- Provider adapters
- Runtime policies
- Persistent storage
- Wallet-aware execution boundaries
- Observability
- Documentation examples
- Test matrix expansion

The backlog section in the final delivery summary from this setup provides a
ready-made issue starter list.
